<p>Bitcoin is one of the world's most popular and valued cryptocurrency since its invention in 2008 bitcoin has shown a massive jump in its price and established itself as a potential investment for investors. But the major thing that goes against investing in Bitcoin is its volatile nature, and it's not the authority of someone. Also, bitcoin is quite volatile, which makes it more difficult to predict its price. To eliminate this cumbersome task, I have created a deep learning system that is capable of predicting and forecasting bitcoin prices with a mean square error of just 1.77.</p>
